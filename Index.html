            <p>Hail and well met, fair adventurer! If you're here, it is because you've found a party and have decided to create a troll character to bolster your group. What a great plan! Trolls add not only strength to a party, but also an endless source of amusement. She or he is the unsung and understated comic relief! Imagine it, all of the bodily functions, smells, appetites for the unusual tastes, along with the simplest of child-like minds rolled into a giant, loveable goofball that doesn't know its own strength! With a troll, you can be the life of the party and the hero protector all in one! Best of luck, adventurer! May your rolls always be high and your DM roll against herself!</p>
